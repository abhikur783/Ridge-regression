    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "Ans:Ridge regression is a linear regression technique used to prevent overfitting in the model by adding a penalty term to the \n",
    "    cost function. The penalty term is a regularization parameter that shrinks the coefficient estimates towards zero, which \n",
    "    reduces the variance of the estimates at the cost of slightly increasing the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge regression, the cost function is modified by adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the \n",
    "coefficient estimates. This penalty term is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization parameter or lambda, which \n",
    "determines the strength of the penalty. The value of lambda is usually determined by cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression is a linear regression technique that finds the best fitting line through a set of data\n",
    "points by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals. Unlike Ridge regression, OLS regression does not have a penalty term and\n",
    "does not take into account the variance of the estimates. This can lead to overfitting when the model is trained on a small \n",
    "dataset or when the number of predictors is large relative to the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between Ridge regression and OLS regression is that Ridge regression uses a penalty term that adds a constrai\n",
    "-nt to the coefficients, which reduces the variance of the estimates, while OLS regression finds the coefficients that minimize \n",
    "the sum of the squared residuals without any constraints."

    "Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?\n",

    "Ridge regression is a linear regression technique that assumes the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations are assumed to be independent of each other.\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "   The value of the tuning parameter, lambda, in Ridge regression can be selected through a process called cross-validation. \n",
    "Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and evaluating the \n",
